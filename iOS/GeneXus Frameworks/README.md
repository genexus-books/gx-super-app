# GeneXus Frameworks

As they are binary, the required .xcframeworks for the sample project are not included in this repository. 
We are currently in the process of migrating to new forms of distribution (surely using [Swift Packages](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages)).
In order to avoid including binaries in the repository, they are temporarily available for [download from GeneXus Site](https://www.genexus.com/en/developers/downloadcenter?data=5995) (contact your local agent in order to get access).
