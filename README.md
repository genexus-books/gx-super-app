# GeneXus Super App Technologies

Native mobile applications are well received in our daily life, but there are still many things that can be done to improve the user's experience.

Before users get the service from a native mobile application, they often have to go through the process of downloading → installing → registering the app. 

In addition, they can only keep a limited number of native apps on their phones due to constraints of storage capability.  What’s more, it's not easy to share data between different native apps.

The evolution of native apps are in general very complicated, as their design was done thinking about a single solution.

The Web is the ideal platform to avoid these problems, but it's by far still imperfect.

Compared to the native, it isn't easy to take advantage of the capabilities provided by the native operating system. Besides, it's usually difficult to design a Web application whose performance can actually match or surpass a similar native app.

On a mobile device, users get services or contents outside the browser very frequently. Naturally, they would like all their applications to be consistent with user accounts, login status, and user interaction across the whole system.

Moreover, sometimes users may want to share some data with an application if they really trust it. However, for some frequently requested information, such as the personal phone number of the current device or the contact list, there isn't a good way for the users to grant permissions on the Web.

In the middle of both solutions, Super Apps were born in China. They are basically service aggregators. WeChat, Taobao, and Baidu were the first aggregators that transformed their applications into Super Apps, opening their platforms so that third parties could include new services within their ecosystem.

GeneXus follows this strategy. Any organization has the possibility of making its own Super App, hence creating new digital ecosystems that offer a variety of services to its community. These services are displayed dynamically through what we call Mini Apps and may be developed by the Super App’s organization itself, or by third parties.

# About this repository
